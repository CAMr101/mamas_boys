                                                The food truck has gained a loyal following of food enthusiasts and has become a go-to spot for foodies seeking trusted and flavourful experiences.
                                                With a background in the vibrant culture of street food, Nhlanhla decided to venture out and create his own brand. His aspiration is for his brand to center around the customer's complete immersion in the diverse array of flavors presented by the distinctive taste of the country. The client exclusively offers street food, specializing in kotaâ€™s and chips.">
